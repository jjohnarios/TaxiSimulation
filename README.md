## Main Idea
We want to understand if a fleet of taxis, scheduled to begin their shifts at 
different times behave in aggregate. Therefore, we create a lot of individual taxis
and let them interact with citizens and have them report their activities back. 

## Goal
Familiarize with generators in Python.

## Output
The output is a log file containing the shift information of each taxi.
